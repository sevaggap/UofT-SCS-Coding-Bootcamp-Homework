# UofT-SCS-Coding-Bootcamp-Homework - Week 1 - Horiseon
## Description

The purpose of this project was to refactor code given to us to make it more accessible. Adding accessibility is important as it allows people with disabilities to access a wide variety of web pages and applications. Through refactoring, the code was cleaned to include semantic HTML elements, accessible alt attributes on photos, and more streamlined sectioning. I learned that there are many ways to do something in HTML, however there are conventions that need to be followed to ensure that the code is easy to read and understand.

## Installation
 Download the repository and open the index.html. Be sure to download all the files as the photos will not load if not included in the directory.

## Usage
The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
